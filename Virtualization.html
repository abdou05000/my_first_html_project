    <h1>Virtualization</h1>
    <p>
      In computing, <b>virtualization</b> refers to the act of creating a virtual <i>(rather than actual)</i> version of something.
      <br>This includes virtual computer hardware, virtual storage devices and virtual network resources.

  <h1>Levels of Virtualization</h1>
  <ol>
    <li> <h4> Virtualization at Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) level </h4>
      Every machine has an instruction set. This set is an interface between software and hardware. Using this instructions software can communicate with hardware.
    </li>
    <li> <h4> Virtualization at Operating System (O.S.) level </h4>
    In virtualization at HAL level each virtual machine is built from scratchi.e. by installing O.S, application suites, networking systems, etc.
    <ul><br>
      <li>In cloud sometimes, we need to initialize 100 Virtual machines at a single time, if we use virtualization at Hardware abstraction layer (HAL) level this can take too much time.</li>
      <li>So, to overcome this in virtualization at Operating system level we share operating system between Virtual machines along with the hardware.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
